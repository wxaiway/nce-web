[00:00.60]Lesson 41|第41课
[00:02.75]Training elephants|训练大象
[00:10.54]At what point does the training of a captive wild elephant begin?|圈养野生大象的训练是从什么时候开始的呢？
[00:17.74]Two main techniques have been used for training elephants, which we may call respectively the tough and the gentle.|训练大象主要采用了两种方法，我们可以分别将它们称为“强硬型”方法与“温和型”方法。
[00:27.25]The former method simply consists of setting an elephant to work and beating him until he does what is expected of him.|旧的方法很简单：就是让大象开始工作，然后不断地鞭打它，直到它按照要求去做为止。
[00:36.67]Apart from any moral considerations this is a stupid method of training,|抛开任何道德方面的考虑不谈，这种训练方法实在愚蠢至极。
[00:42.29]for it produces a resentful animal who at a later stage may well turn man-killer.|因为这会造就一只心怀怨恨的动物，而这种动物在未来很可能会变成杀人犯。
[00:49.31]The gentle method requires more patience in the early stages,|这种温和的方法在初期需要更多的耐心。
[00:53.72]but produce a cheerful good-tempered elephant who will give many years of loyal service.|不过，最终会诞生出一头性格开朗、脾气温和的大象，它将为我们提供多年忠诚的服务。
[01:01.86]The first essential in elephant training is to assign to the animal a single mahout who will be entirely responsible for the job.|在大象训练中，首要的一点就是为每头大象指定一名专门的驯象师，这名驯象师将完全负责大象的训练工作。
[01:12.02]Elephants like to have one master just as dogs do, and are capable of a considerable degree of personal affection.|大象和狗一样，也需要一个主人来照顾它们；它们也能够表现出相当程度的亲密情感（即对主人的喜爱或依赖）。
[01:21.71]There are even stories of half-trained elephant calves who have refused to feed and pined to death|甚至还有这样的故事：那些只接受过部分训练的小象会拒绝进食，最终因饥饿而死亡。
[01:30.54]when by some unavoidable circumstance they have been deprived of their own trainer.|当由于某些不可避免的情况，他们失去了自己的教练时……
[01:38.41]Such extreme cases must probably be taken with a grain of salt,|对于这类极端案例，我们或许应该持保留态度（即不要完全相信它们的真实性）。
[01:43.26]but they do underline the general principle that the relationship between elephant and mahout is the key to successful training.|但他们确实强调了这样一个基本原则：大象与驯象师之间的关系是成功训练大象的关键。
[01:54.24]The most economical age to capture an elephant for training is between 15 and 20 years,|捕捉大象进行训练的最佳年龄是在15到20岁之间。
[02:01.53]for it is then almost ready to undertake heavy work and can begin to earn its keep straight away.|因为那时它已经差不多准备好承担繁重的工作了，可以立即开始为自己创造价值（即开始赚钱或发挥其应有的作用）。
[02:09.29]But animals of this age do not easily become subservient to man, and a very firm hand must be employed in the early stages.|但是这个年龄段的动物并不容易屈服于人类；在初期阶段，必须采取非常强硬的手段（或：必须使用强制性的方法）才能让它们服从人类的控制。
[02:19.42]The captive elephant, still roped to a tree,|那头被囚禁的大象仍然被绳子拴在树上……
[02:22.74]plunges and screams every time a man approaches, and for several days will probably refuse all food through anger and fear.|每当有男人靠近时，它就会惊慌失措、尖叫不已；出于愤怒和恐惧，它可能会连续几天拒绝进食。
[02:34.27]Sometimes a tame elephant is tethered nearby to give the wild one confidence,|有时候，人们会把一头驯服的大象拴在附近，以此来让野生的大象感到安心（或有安全感）。
[02:40.27]and in most cases the captive gradually quietens down and begins to accept its food.|在大多数情况下，被关押的动物会逐渐安静下来，并开始接受所提供的食物。
[02:47.81]The next stage is to get the elephant to the training establishment,|下一个步骤是将大象送到训练机构去。
[02:51.87]a ticklish business which is achieved with the aid of two tame elephants roped to the captive on either side.|这是一项需要小心处理的操作；具体方法是利用两头被驯服的大象，将它们用绳子拴在需要被移动的物体两侧，从而帮助完成这项工作。
[02:59.97]When several elephants are being trained at one time,|当同时有多头大象正在接受训练时，
[03:04.05]it is customary for the new arrival to be placed between the stalls of two captives whose training is already well advanced.|按照惯例，新来的成员会被安排到两名训练已经相当熟练的囚犯中间。
[03:13.88]It is then left completely undisturbed with plenty of food and water|之后，它就被完全放任不管了，周围有充足的食物和水。
[03:19.15]so that it can absorb the atmosphere of its new home and see that nothing particularly alarming is happening to its companions.|这样它就能适应新环境的气氛，并确认它的同伴们没有遇到任何特别令人担忧的问题。
[03:28.39]When it is eating normally, its own training begins.|当它开始正常进食时，它的“自我训练”过程也就开始了。
[03:33.27]The trainer stands in front of the elephant holding a long stick with a sharp metal point.|驯象师站在大象面前，手中拿着一根带有锋利金属尖端的长棍。
[03:39.70]Two assistants, mounted on tame elephants, control the captive from either side,|两名助手骑在驯服的大象背上，从两侧分别控制着那个被囚禁的人。
[03:46.63]while others rub their hands over his skin to the accompaniment of a monotonous and soothing chant.|而其他人则一边重复着单调而舒缓的咒语，一边用手轻轻抚摸他的皮肤。
[03:55.06]This is supposed to induce pleasurable sensations in the elephant,|这应该是为了给大象带来愉悦的感觉。
[03:59.73]and its effects are reinforced by the use of endearing epithets,|其效果通过使用那些亲切、可爱的称呼（或称谓）得到了进一步的强化。
[04:03.69]such as 'ho! my son', or 'ho! my father', or 'my mother', according to the age and sex of the captive.|例如“嗬！我的儿子”或“嗬！我的父亲”，或者“我的母亲”——这些称呼会根据被俘者的年龄和性别来决定。
[04:15.71]The elephant is not immediately susceptible to such blandishments, however, and usually lashes fiercely with its trunk in all directions.|然而，大象并不会立刻被这些花言巧语所打动；它通常会用鼻子猛烈地朝四面八方挥打。
[04:25.47]These movements are controlled by the trainer with the metal-pointed stick,|这些动作是由训练者通过一根带有金属尖端的棍子来控制的。
[04:30.01]and the trunk eventually becomes so sore that the elephant curls it up and seldom afterwards uses it for offensive purposes.|最终，大象的鼻子会变得非常疼痛；因此大象会将其蜷缩起来，之后也很少再使用它的鼻子来进行攻击性动作。
