[00:02.70]The stuff of dreams|梦中的奥秘
[00:10.86]What is going on when a person experiences rapid eye-movements during sleep?|当人在睡眠中经历快速眼动（REM）时，究竟发生了什么？
[00:18.37]It is fairly clear that the sleeping period must have some function, and because there is so much of it the function would seem to be important.|很明显，睡眠一定具有某种功能，而且由于这种状态持续的时间很长，因此这种功能必定非常重要。
[00:28.71]Speculations about its nature have been going on for literally thousands of years,|关于睡眠本质的猜测已经持续了数千年之久。
[00:35.16]and one odd finding that makes the problem puzzling is that it looks very much as if sleeping is not simply a matter of giving the body a rest.|一个令人困惑的现象是：睡眠似乎并不仅仅是让身体休息的过程。
[00:45.36]'Rest', in terms of muscle relaxation and so on, can be achieved by a brief period lying, or even sitting down.|从肌肉放松的角度来看，即使只是短暂地躺下或坐着，也能达到休息的效果。
[00:55.75]The body's tissues are self-repairing and self-restoring to a degree, and function best when more or less continuously active.|人体组织本身具备自我修复和恢复的功能，而且在保持一定程度的活动状态下，其功能才能达到最佳状态。
[01:06.27]In fact a basic amount of movement occurs during sleep which is specifically concerned with preventing muscle inactivity.|事实上，睡眠期间确实会发生一些活动，这些活动专门用于防止肌肉长时间处于静止状态。
[01:15.66]If it is not a question of resting the body, then perhaps it is the brain that needs resting?|如果睡眠的目的不是为了让身体休息，那么或许大脑才是需要休息的对象？
[01:23.65]This might be a plausible hypothesis were it not for two factors.|这个假设听起来似乎合理，但有两个因素需要考虑：
[01:29.37]First the electroencephalograph (which is simply a device for recording the electrical activity of the brain by attaching electrodes to the scalp)|首先，脑电图（EEG）是一种通过将电极贴在头皮上来记录大脑电活动的设备……
[01:40.75]shows that while there is a change in the pattern of activity during sleep,|研究表明，虽然睡眠期间的活动模式会发生变化，
[01:45.80]there is no evidence that the total amount of activity is any less.|没有证据表明总体活动量有任何减少。
[01:51.36]The second factor is more interesting and more fundamental.|第二个因素更加有趣，也更为根本。
[01:56.00]Some years ago an American psychiatrist named William Dement published experiments dealing with the recording of eye-movements during sleep.|几年前，一位名叫威廉·德门特（William Dement）的美国精神病学家发表了一项研究，该研究记录了人们在睡眠期间的眼球运动情况。
[02:06.91]He showed that the average individual's sleep cycle is punctuated with peculiar bursts of eye-movements, some drifting and slow, others jerky and rapid.|他发现，普通人的睡眠周期中会伴随着一些特殊的眼球运动现象：有些眼球运动较为缓慢、平稳，而另一些则突然、快速地发生。
[02:20.33]People woken during these periods of eye-movements generally reported that they had been dreaming.|在眼球运动期间被唤醒的人通常报告说他们正在做梦。
[02:26.91]When woken at other times they reported no dreams.|在其他时间被唤醒时，他们表示自己没有做任何梦。
[02:30.85]If one group of people were disturbed from their eye-movement sleep for several nights on end,|如果有一组人的眼球运动睡眠（REM sleep）连续几个晚上都被中断的话……
[02:36.30]and another group were disturbed for an equal period of time but when they were not exhibiting eye-movements,|另一组实验对象也被同样长的时间所干扰，但在这段时间里他们并没有表现出任何眼球运动（即他们的目光没有发生任何移动）。
[02:45.44]the first group began to show some personality disorders while the others seemed more or less unaffected.|第一组开始出现一些人格障碍的症状，而其他组则几乎没有受到影响。
[02:54.88]The implications of all this were that it was not the disturbance of sleep that mattered, but the disturbance of dreaming.|所有这些现象表明，真正重要的是睡眠本身的中断，而不是梦境本身的中断。
