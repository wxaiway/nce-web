[ti:The Sculptor Speaks]
[00:00.61]Lesson 31|第31课
[00:02.76]The sculptor speaks|雕塑家开口说话了。
[00:10.95]What do you have to be able to do to appreciate sculpture?|要真正欣赏雕塑，你需要具备哪些条件或能力呢？
[00:17.35]Appreciation of sculpture depends upon the ability to respond to form in 3 dimensions.|对雕塑的欣赏，取决于人们能否理解和回应三维空间中的形态（即雕塑的立体结构与形态特征）。
[00:25.69]That is perhaps why sculpture has been described as the most difficult of all arts;|也许正因为如此，雕塑才被人们称为所有艺术形式中最难掌握的一种。
[00:32.10]certainly it is more difficult than the arts which involve appreciation of flat forms, shape in only two dimensions.|当然，这比那些只需要欣赏二维平面形状的艺术形式要困难得多。
[00:41.91]Many more people are 'form-blind' than colour-blind.|实际上，有更多的人存在“形式盲”（即无法区分不同形式的视觉信息）的问题，而不是“色盲”（即无法区分不同颜色的视觉信息）。
[00:48.46]The child learning to see, first distinguishes only two-dimensional shape; it cannot judge distances, depths.|正在学习视力的孩子最初只能识别二维的形状；他们还无法判断距离或物体的深度。
[00:57.88]Later, for its personal safety and practical needs, it has to develop (partly by means of touch) the ability to judge roughly 3-dimensonal distances.|后来，为了自身的安全以及实际生活的需要，它必须逐渐培养出判断三维空间距离的能力（这部分是通过触觉来实现的）。
[01:11.81]But having satisfied the requirements of practical necessity, most people go no further.|然而，在满足了实际需求之后，大多数人就不会再进一步去追求更高的目标了。
[01:18.94]Though they may attain considerable accuracy in the perception of flat form,|尽管它们在识别平面图形方面可以达到相当高的准确度，
[01:24.99]they do not make the further intellectual and emotional effort needed to comprehend form in its full spatial existence.|他们没有付出进一步的智力与情感努力，去全面理解“形式”在其空间存在中的本质（即形式在三维空间中的具体表现方式）。
[01:35.23]This is what the sculptor must do.|这就是雕塑家必须做的事情。
[01:38.04]He must strive continually to think of and use, form in its full spatial completeness.|他必须不断努力，去思考并运用那些能够完整地反映空间结构的概念（或方法）。
[01:46.88]He gets the solid shape as it were, inside his head--he thinks of it, whatever its size, as if he were holding it completely enclosed in the hollow of his hand.|他在脑海中清晰地想象出那个物体的形状；无论这个物体的实际大小如何，他都仿佛能够将其完全握在手中一样。
[02:00.70]He mentally visualizes a complex form from all round itself;|他在脑海中想象出一个从各个方向看都呈复杂形状的物体（或结构）。
[02:07.30]he knows while he looks at one side what the other side is like; he identifies himself with its centre of gravity, its mass, its weight;|当他注视着某一方时，他其实也知道另一方的样子；他将自己与那方的“重心”、“质量”以及“重量”联系在一起（即将自己视为那方的一个组成部分）。
[02:18.34]he realizes its volume as the space that the shape displaces in the air.|他认识到这个物体的“体积”，其实就是该物体在空气中占据的空间（即该物体将空气“挤开”后所形成的空间）。
[02:24.81]And the sensitive observer of sculpture must also learn to feel shape simply as shape, not as description or reminiscence.|对于雕塑而言，敏锐的观察者也必须学会纯粹地将形状视为形状本身来感知它，而不是将其视为某种描述或回忆的象征。
[02:34.47]He must, for example, perceive an egg as a simple single solid shape quite apart from its significance as food,|例如，他必须将鸡蛋仅仅视为一个简单的、独立的固体形状，而忽略其作为食物的意义。
[02:44.43]or from the literary idea that it will become a bird.|或者，基于这种文学观念——即它最终会变成一只鸟。
[02:49.08]And so with solids such as a shell, a nut, a plum, a pear, a tadpole, a mushroom,|因此，对于像贝壳、螺母、李子、梨子、蝌蚪、蘑菇这样的固体物体来说……
[02:58.09]a mountain peak, a kidney, a carrot, a tree-trunk, a bird, a bud, a lark, a ladybird, a bulrush, a bone.|一座山峰、一个肾脏、一根胡萝卜、一根树干、一只鸟、一个花蕾、一只云雀、一只瓢虫、一种香蒲植物、一根骨头。
[03:11.28]From these he can go on to appreciate more complex forms or combinations of several forms.|从这些基础形式出发，他可以进一步理解更复杂的结构，或是几种形式之间的组合。
