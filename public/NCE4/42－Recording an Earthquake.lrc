[00:00.54]Lesson 42|第42课
[00:02.45]Recording an earthquake|记录地震数据
[00:09.95]What does a pen have to do to record on paper the vibrations generated by an earthquake?|一支笔要如何才能在纸上记录下地震产生的震动呢？
[00:18.95]An earthquake comes like a thief in the night, without warning.|地震就像夜间的小偷一样，毫无预兆地突然降临。
[00:23.69]It was necessary, therefore, to invent instruments that neither slumbered nor slept.|因此，有必要发明那些既不会“沉睡”也不会“休息”的仪器（即那些能够持续运行、不会停止工作的设备）。
[00:29.84]Some devices were quite simple.|有些设备的设计非常简单。
[00:32.36]One, for instance, consisted of rods of various lengths and thicknesses which would stand up on end like ninepins.|例如，其中有一个装置由长度和厚度各不相同的杆子组成；这些杆子可以像九柱戏（ninepins）中的柱子一样竖立起来。
[00:41.06]When a shock came, it shook the rigid table upon which these stood.|当那股冲击波传来时，它震动了那些物品所放置的坚硬桌子。
[00:46.36]If it were gentle, only the more unstable rods fell.|如果这种作用力是温和的（即不剧烈的），那么只会是那些更加不稳定的杆子才会倒下。
[00:51.17]If it were severe, they all fell.|如果情况严重的话，它们都会全部倒下。
[00:53.99]Thus the rods, by falling, and by the direction in which they fell,|因此，这些杆子在下落的过程中，以及根据它们下落的方向……
[00:58.85]recorded for the slumbering scientist the strength of a shock that was too weak to waken him,|为那位正在沉睡的科学家记录下了那次冲击的强度——不过那次冲击实在太微弱了，根本无法将他唤醒。
[01:05.70]and the direction from which it came.|以及它来自的方向。
[01:08.99]But instruments far more delicate than that were needed if any really serious advance was to be made.|但是，如果要取得真正重大的进展，就需要使用比那些仪器更加精密的设备。
[01:15.87]The ideal to be aimed at was to devise an instrument that could record with a pen on paper,|我们的目标是设计一种能够用笔在纸上记录信息的工具。
[01:22.77]the movements of the ground or of the table as the quake passed by.|地震发生时，地面或桌子的晃动情况。
[01:28.24]While I write my pen moves, but the paper keeps still.|当我写字时，笔在动，但纸却静止不动。
[01:32.57]With practice, no doubt, I could in time learn to write by holding the pen still while the paper moved.|通过练习，我相信我最终能够学会在纸张移动的同时保持笔静止不动来进行书写。
[01:39.75]That sounds a silly suggestion,|那听起来真是个愚蠢的建议。
[01:42.31]but that was precisely the idea adopted in some of the early instruments (seismometers) for recording earthquake waves.|但这正是某些早期地震仪在记录地震波时所采用的设计理念。
[01:51.70]But when table, penholder and paper are all moving, how is it possible to write legibly?|但是当桌子、笔架和纸张都在移动时，怎么可能还能写出清晰可读的文字呢？
[01:59.02]The key to a solution of that problem lay in an everyday observation.|解决那个问题的关键在于一个日常的观察结果。
[02:04.18]Why does a person standing in a bus or train tend to fall when a sudden start is made?|为什么当公交车或火车突然启动时，站在上面的人容易摔倒呢？
[02:10.59]It is because his feet move on, but his head stays still.|这是因为他的脚在不停地移动，但他的头部却保持静止不动。
[02:15.18]A simple experiment will help us a little further.|一个简单的实验能帮助我们进一步理解这个原理。
[02:18.39]Tie a heavy weight at the end of a long piece of string.|在一段较长的绳子末端系上一个重物。
[02:22.24]With the hand held high in the air, hold the string so that the weight nearly touches the ground.|将绳子高高举过头顶，使重物几乎触碰到地面。
[02:28.78]Now move the hand to and fro and around but not up and down.|然后让手在水平方向上前后移动，但不要上下移动。
[02:33.76]It will be found that the weight moves but slightly or not at all.|你会发现，重物几乎不会移动，或者只会轻微移动。
[02:38.34]Imagine a pen attached to the weight in such a way that its point rests upon a piece of paper on the floor.|想象一下，有一支笔被固定在重物上，其笔尖接触着地面上的一张纸。
[02:44.93]Imagine an earthquake shock shaking the floor, the paper, you and your hand.|再想象一场地震，地震使地面、纸张以及你的手都在震动。
[02:51.42]In the midst of all this movement, the weight and the pen would be still.|在所有这些震动中，重物和笔是静止的；
[02:55.97]But as the paper moved from side to side under the pen point, its movement would be recorded in ink upon its surface.|但当纸张在笔尖下左右移动时，纸张的运动会通过墨水在纸上留下痕迹。
[03:04.18]It was upon this principle that the first instruments were made, but the paper was wrapped round a drum which rotated slowly.|最早的测量仪器就是基于这个原理制造的——只不过当时的纸张是缠绕在一个缓慢旋转的鼓上的。
[03:13.20]As long as all was still, the pen drew a straight line,|当一切保持静止时，笔会画出一条直线；
[03:17.64]but while the drum was being shaken, the line that the pen was drawing wriggled from side to side.|而当鼓开始震动时，笔所画的线就会左右摇晃、变得弯曲不平。
[03:25.18]The apparatus thus described, however,|然而，如此描述的这个装置……
[03:27.85]records only the horizontal component of the wave movement, which is, in fact, much more complicated.|该设备仅记录了波浪运动的水平分量，而实际上波浪运动的过程要复杂得多。
[03:35.21]If we could actually see the path described by a particle,|如果我们真的能够看到粒子所描绘的轨迹的话……
[03:39.21]such as a sand grain in the rock,|就像岩石中的一粒沙子一样……
[03:41.95]it would be more like that of a bluebottle buzzing round the room; it would be up and down, to and fro and from side to side.|它更像是一只蓝瓶子（一种昆虫）在房间里飞来飞去；它会上下移动，来回穿梭，从一边飞到另一边。
[03:50.54]Instruments have been devised and can be so placed that all three elements can be recorded in different graphs.|已经设计出了相应的仪器，可以将这些仪器放置在与之相适应的位置，从而能够将这三个要素分别记录在不同的图表中。
[03:58.84]When the instrument is situated at more than 700 miles from the earthquake centre,|当该仪器距离地震中心超过700英里时，
[04:04.62]the graphic record shows three waves arriving one after the other at short intervals.|该图表显示有三波信号以较短的间隔依次传来。
[04:10.63]The first records the arrival of longitudinal vibrations.|第一条记录显示了纵向振动的出现。
[04:15.56]The second marks the arrival of transverse vibrations which travel more slowly and arrive several minutes after the first.|第二次震动标志着横向振动的开始；这些横向振动传播速度较慢，因此在第一次震动发生几分钟后才到达。
[04:25.16]These two have travelled through the earth.|这两样东西已经穿越了整个地球。
[04:27.87]It was from the study of these that so much was learnt about the interior of the earth.|正是通过对这些现象的研究，我们才对地球的内部结构有了如此多的了解。
[04:33.66]The third, or main wave is the slowest and has travelled round the earth through the surface rocks.|第三波，也就是主波，是传播速度最慢的一波。它通过地表的岩石层在地球上进行了传播。
