[00:01.06]Lesson 29|第29课
[00:02.96]The hovercraft|气垫船
[00:10.31]What is a hovercraft riding on when it is in motion?|气垫船在运动时是“骑”在什么上面的呢？
[00:16.55]Many strange new means of transport have been developed in our century,|在我们这个世纪，许多新型的、奇特的交通工具被开发出来了。
[00:22.29]the strangest of them being perhaps the hovercraft.|其中最奇怪的，或许要数那艘气垫船了。
[00:27.29]In 1953, a former electronics engineer in his fifties, Christopher Cockerell,|1953年，一位五十多岁的前电子工程师克里斯托弗·科克雷尔（Christopher Cockerell）……
[00:35.44]who had turned to boat-building on the Norfolk Broads,|谁开始在诺福克河口地区从事造船业呢？
[00:39.52]suggested an idea on which he had been working for many years to the British Government and industrial circles.|他向英国政府和工业界提出了一项自己多年来一直在研究的想法。
[00:48.13]It was the idea of supporting a craft on a 'pad', or cushion, of low-pressure air, ringed with a curtain of higher pressure air.|这个想法的核心在于：利用一层低压空气作为“垫子”或“支撑层”来托住某个物体（比如飞行器），而该低压空气层则被一层高压空气所包围。
[01:00.20]Ever since, people have had difficulty in deciding whether the craft should be ranged among ships, planes,|从那以后，人们就一直难以确定这种交通工具应该被归类为船舶、飞机中的哪一类。
[01:09.38]or land vehicles--for it is something in between a boat and an aircraft.|或者陆地交通工具——因为它介于船和飞机之间。
[01:17.57]As a shipbuilder, Cockerell was trying to find a solution to the problem of the wave resistance which wastes a good deal of a surface ship's power and limits its speed.|作为一名造船工程师，科克雷尔一直在努力寻找解决船舶波浪阻力问题的方法。波浪阻力会浪费船舶大量动力，并限制其航行速度。
[01:31.54]His answer was to lift the vessel out of the water by making it ride on a cushion of air, no more than one or two feet thick.|他的解决方案是让船漂浮在一片空气“垫层”上，这片空气垫层的厚度不超过一两英尺。
[01:42.60]This is done by a great number of ring-shaped air jets on the bottom of the craft.|这是通过飞船底部大量环形喷气装置来实现的。
[01:49.60]It 'flies', therefore, but it cannot fly higher--its action depends on the surface, water or ground, over which it rides.|因此，它确实能够“飞行”，但它无法飞得更高；它的运动方式取决于它所依附的表面——无论是水面还是地面。
[02:02.29]The first tests on the Solent in 1959 caused a sensation.|1959年，对“Solent”进行的初步测试引起了轰动。
[02:08.57]The hovercraft travelled first over the water, then mounted the beach, climbed up the dunes, and sat down on a road.|气垫船先在水面上行驶，然后驶上了沙滩，接着爬上了沙丘，最后停在了道路上。
[02:19.57]Later it crossed the Channel, riding smoothly over the waves, which presented no problem.|后来，它穿过了英吉利海峡，平稳地掠过海浪——整个过程没有任何问题。
[02:28.89]Since that time, various types of hovercraft have appeared and taken up regular service.|从那时起，各种类型的气垫船相继问世，并开始被广泛使用（即投入日常运营）。
[02:36.31]The hovercraft is particularly useful in large areas with poor communications such as Africa or Australia;|气垫船在通信条件较差的广大地区（如非洲或澳大利亚）特别有用。
[02:44.82]it can become a 'flying fruit-bowl', carrying bananas from the plantations to the ports;|它可以变成一个“会飞的果盘”，负责将香蕉从种植园运送到港口。
[02:51.89]giant hovercraft liners could span the Atlantic;|巨大的气垫船客轮或许能够横渡大西洋。
[02:55.67]and the railway of the future may well be the 'hovertrain',|未来的铁路很可能会是“悬浮列车”。
[02:59.99]riding on its air cushion over a single rail, which it never touches, at speeds, up to 300 m.p.h.--the possibilities appear unlimited.|这种装置依靠空气垫在单根轨道上行驶，且从未与轨道接触；其行驶速度可达到每小时300英里。由此看来，它的应用可能性似乎是无限的。
