[00:00.48]Lesson 58|第58课
[00:02.48]A spot of bother|一个小麻烦；一点小问题。
[00:09.52]What did the old lady find when she got home?|那位老太太回家后发现了什么？
[00:14.73]The old lady was glad to be back at the block of flats where she lived.|那位老太太很高兴能够回到她居住的公寓楼。
[00:20.86]Her shopping had tired her and her basket had grown heavier with every step of the way home.|她的购物让她感到疲惫不堪；而随着她一步步往家走，她手中的购物篮也越来越重了。
[00:28.27]In the lift her thoughts were on lunch and a good rest;|在电梯里，她的思绪都在午餐和好好休息的事情上。
[00:32.65]but when she got out at her own floor, both were forgotten in her sudden discovery that her front door was open.|但当她走到自己所在的楼层时，她突然发现前门是开着的，这一发现让她完全忘记了之前发生的一切。
[00:42.07]She was thinking that she must reprimand her home help the next morning for such a monstrous piece of negligence,|她在想，第二天早上一定要严厉责备她的家政人员，因为这种疏忽实在太严重了。
[00:50.44]when she remembered that she had gone shopping after the home help had left and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks.|当她想起家政人员离开后自己去了购物，而且知道自己已经把两把钥匙都插进了相应的锁孔里时……
[01:00.63]She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open,|她缓缓走进大厅，立刻注意到所有的房间门都敞开着。
[01:07.58]yet following her regular practice she had shut them before going out.|然而，按照她平时的习惯，她在出门前还是把它们关上了。
[01:12.69]Looking into the drawing room, she saw a scene of confusion over by her writing desk.|她走进客厅，看到她的书桌旁一片混乱的景象。
[01:19.28]It was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced an entry during her absence.|当时就很明显了：在她的不在期间，窃贼强行进入了房子。
[01:25.89]Her first impulse was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves,|她的第一反应是去各个房间寻找小偷。
[01:31.23]but then she decided that at her age it might be more prudent to have someone with her,|但后来她想，以她的年纪来说，有个人陪在身边可能会更稳妥些。
[01:37.62]so she went to fetch the porter from his basement.|于是她下楼去把门房从他的地下室叫了出来。
[01:41.71]By this time her legs were beginning to tremble, so she sat down and accepted a cup of very strong tea, while he telephoned the police.|这时，她的双腿已经开始颤抖了，于是她坐下来喝了一杯浓茶；与此同时，他拨打了报警电话。
[01:52.27]Then, her composure regained, she was ready to set off with the porter's assistance to search for any intruders who might still be lurking in her flat.|随后，她恢复了镇定，便在门卫的协助下准备出发，去搜寻可能还潜伏在她公寓里的入侵者。
[02:04.54]They went through the rooms, being careful to touch nothing,|他们走过一个又一个房间，小心翼翼地避免触碰任何东西。
[02:08.73]as they did not want to hinder the police in their search for fingerprints.|因为他们不想妨碍警方寻找指纹的工作。
[02:13.88]The chaos was inconceivable.|那种混乱简直难以想象。
[02:17.27]She had lived in the flat for thirty years and was a veritable magpie at hoarding:|她已经在这套公寓里住了三十年，是个十足的“收集狂”——总是喜欢囤积各种东西。
[02:23.59]and it seemed as though everything she possessed had been tossed out and turned over and over.|仿佛她拥有的一切都被彻底翻了个个儿，被彻底弄乱了。
[02:31.08]At least sorting out the things she should have discarded years ago was now being made easier for her.|至少，把她那些早就该扔掉的东西整理好这件事，现在对她来说变得容易多了。
[02:38.73]Then a police inspector arrived with a constable and she told them of her discovery of the ransacked flat.|随后，一名警督带着一名警察来到了现场，她向他们报告了自己发现公寓被洗劫的情况。
[02:47.15]The inspector began to look for fingerprints, while the constable checked that the front door locks had not been forced,|检查员开始寻找指纹，而警察则确认前门的锁没有被强行破坏。
[02:54.40]thereby proving that the burglars had either used skeleton keys or entered over the balcony.|由此可以证明，窃贼要么使用了万能钥匙，要么是从阳台上进入屋内的。
[03:02.03]There was no trace of fingerprints, but the inspector found a dirty red bundle that contained jewellery which the old lady said was not hers.|没有发现任何指纹的痕迹，但检查员发现了一个脏兮兮的红色包裹，里面装着一些首饰。那位老妇人声称这些首饰并不属于她。
[03:13.07]So their entry into this flat was apparently not the burglars' first job that day and they must have been disturbed.|显然，他们当天进入这套公寓并不是第一次作案；他们肯定遇到了什么干扰（或者：他们的行动被别人发现了）。
[03:21.84]The inspector then asked the old lady to try to check what was missing by the next day,|然后，检查员让那位老太太在第二天之前试着看看到底少了什么东西。
[03:28.20]and advised her not to stay alone in the flat for a few nights.|并建议她在接下来的几个晚上不要独自待在公寓里。
[03:32.11]The old lady thought he was a fussy creature,|那位老太太认为他是个挑剔的人。
[03:36.47]but since the porter agreed with him, she rang up her daughter and asked for her help in what she described as a little spot of bother.|但由于门房同意了他的请求，她便给女儿打了电话，请求她的帮助来处理这个她所说的“小麻烦”。
