[00:02.20]Modern cavemen|现代“穴居人”
[00:09.46]With what does the writer compare the Gouffre Berger?|作者将“贝杰尔洞穴”（Gouffre Berger）比作什么？
[00:15.31]Cave exploration, or pot-holing, as it has come to be known, is a relatively new sport.|洞穴探险，也就是现在人们常说的“pot-holing”，其实是一项相对较新的运动。
[00:23.34]Perhaps it is the desire for solitude or the chance of making an unexpected discovery that lures people down to the depths of the earth.|也许，正是对孤独的渴望，或是希望做出意外发现的心情，驱使人们前往地球的深处。
[00:34.42]It is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer's motives.|对于那些懒惰、逃避责任的人（即“pot-holers”）的动机，根本不可能给出一个令人满意的解释。
[00:40.92]For him, caves have the same peculiar fascination which high mountains have for the climber.|对他来说，洞穴具有与高山对登山者同样的独特吸引力。
[00:48.99]They arouse instincts which can only be dimly understood.|它们唤醒了一些我们只能勉强理解的本能。
[00:54.42]Exploring really deep caves is not a task for the Sunday afternoon rambler.|探索那些极其深邃的洞穴，绝不是适合在周日午后闲逛时去完成的任务。
[01:00.19]Such undertakings require the precise planning and foresight of military operations.|这样的行动需要精确的军事计划和深远的预见性。
[01:08.04]It can take as long as eight days to rig up rope ladders and to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very deep cave.|在进入一个非常深的洞穴之前，搭建绳梯并建立补给基地可能需要长达八天的时间。
[01:20.61]Precautions of this sort are necessary, for it is impossible to foretell the exact nature of the difficulties which will confront the pot-holer.|采取这样的预防措施是必要的，因为我们无法预先预测那些可能会困扰（或困扰某人）的困难的具体性质。
[01:32.06]The deepest known cave in the world is the Gouffre Berger near Grenoble.|世界上已知最深的洞穴是位于格勒诺布尔附近的贝尔热洞穴（Gouffre Berger）。
[01:38.66]It extends to a depth of 3, 723 feet.|它的深度达到了3,723英尺。
[01:44.33]This immense chasm has been formed by an underground stream which has tunnelled a course through a flaw in the rocks.|这个巨大的峡谷是由一条地下溪流形成的；这条溪流在岩石的裂缝中穿行，逐渐侵蚀出了这条通道。
[01:53.65]The entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphine Alps.|洞穴的入口位于多菲内阿尔卑斯山脉的一个高原上。
[02:00.13]As it is only six feet across, it is barely noticeable.|由于它的宽度只有六英尺，几乎看不出来它的存在。
[02:05.39]The cave might never have been discovered had not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French pot-holer, Berger.|如果那个洞穴的入口没有被那位著名的法国酒鬼伯杰发现的话，它可能永远都不会被人发现。
[02:15.00]Since its discovery, it has become a sort of pot-holers' Everest.|自从它被发现以来，它就成了那些喜欢在废墟中探险的人们的“珠穆朗玛峰”——一个令人向往、充满挑战的目标。
[02:20.66]Though a number of descents have been made, much of it still remains to be explored.|尽管已经有人多次尝试探索那里，但仍有很大一部分区域尚未被人类发现或探索。
[02:27.85]A team of pot-holers recently went down the Gouffre Berger.|最近，一支由洞穴探险者组成的团队进入了贝尔热洞（Gouffre Berger）。
[02:33.27]After entering the narrow gap on the plateau,|在进入高原上的那个狭窄缝隙之后……
[02:36.96]they climbed down the steep sides of the cave until they came to a narrow corridor.|他们沿着洞穴陡峭的侧壁向下爬行，直到来到一条狭窄的通道前。
[02:43.62]They had to edge their way along this,|他们不得不沿着这条路小心翼翼地前行。
[02:46.29]sometimes wading across shallow streams, or swimming across deep pools.|有时候需要涉水穿过浅流；有时候则需要游过深水区。
[02:52.62]Suddenly they came to a waterfall which dropped into an underground lake at the bottom of the cave.|突然，他们来到了一处瀑布前；那瀑布的水流直接注入了洞穴底部的一个地下湖泊中。
[03:00.69]They plunged into the lake, and after loading their gear on an inflatable rubber dinghy, let the current carry them to the other side.|他们跳进了湖里，然后将装备装上了一个充气橡胶小艇，让水流将他们带到对岸。
[03:11.67]To protect themselves from the icy water, they had to wear special rubber suits.|为了防止被冰冷的水冻伤，他们不得不穿上特制的橡胶防护服。
[03:18.58]At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of rubble which had been washed up by the water.|在湖的尽头，他们看到了一堆堆巨大的废墟，这些废墟是被水冲上岸来的。
[03:26.87]In this part of the cave, they could hear an insistent booming sound|在这个洞穴的区域内，他们能听到一种持续不断的、低沉的轰鸣声。
[03:32.17]which they found was caused by a small waterspout shooting down into a pool from the roof of the cave.|他们发现，这种现象是由于一个小型“水龙卷”从洞穴的屋顶冲下来，落入了一个水池中而引起的。
[03:40.42]Squeezing through a cleft in the rocks, the pot-holers arrived at an enormous cavern, the size of a huge concert hall.|穿过岩石间的裂缝，那些洞穴探险者终于来到了一处巨大的洞穴——其规模相当于一座大型音乐厅。
[03:49.72]After switching on powerful arc lights,|在打开强力的弧光灯之后，
[03:53.00]they saw great stalagmites--some of them over forty feet high--rising up like tree-trunks to meet the stalactites suspended from the roof.|他们看到了那些巨大的石笋——其中一些高达四十多英尺——这些石笋像树干一样矗立着，与从屋顶悬挂下来的钟乳石相接。
[04:05.43]Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all the colours of the rainbow.|周围，成堆的石灰岩闪烁着彩虹般的各种色彩。
[04:12.14]In the eerie silence of the cavern, the only sound that could be heard was made by water which dripped continuously from the high dome above them.|在洞穴那令人毛骨悚然的寂静中，唯一能听到的声音，就是从他们头顶的高耸穹顶上不断滴落的水声。
