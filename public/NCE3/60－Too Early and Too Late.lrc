[00:31.53]Only in a sparsely-populated rural community is it possible to disregard it.|只有在人口稀少的农村社区，人们才有可能忽视这个问题（或：只有在这样的环境中，人们才有可能对这个问题视而不见）。

[00:53.53]He is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party.|因此，如果他因为晚到而错过了晚宴，也是可以被原谅的。
[00:58.07]But people are often reproached for unpunctuality when their only fault is cutting things fine.|但是，人们常常因为不守时而受到指责，而他们真正的过错其实只是稍微提前完成了任务（即比原定时间提前完成了工作）。
[01:05.63]It is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time,|对于那些精力充沛、思维敏捷的人来说，浪费时间是一件很难做到的事情。

[01:57.69]If you are catching a train, it is always better to be comfortably early than even a fraction of a minute too late.|如果你要赶火车，提前到达总是更好的选择——哪怕只是提前几分钟也好，总比迟到哪怕一小会儿要好得多。
