[00:00.33]Lesson 59|第59课
[00:02.40]Collecting|收集；采集
[00:08.71]What in particular does a person gain when he or she becomes a serious collector?|一个人成为真正的收藏家后，具体能获得什么呢？
[00:17.12]People tend to amass possessions, sometimes without being aware of doing so.|人们往往会积累财物，有时甚至自己都没有意识到这一点。
[00:22.96]Indeed they can have a delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned.|确实，当他们发现某些自己原本不知道拥有的、但却非常实用的东西时，会感到非常惊喜。
[00:30.68]Those who never have to move house become indiscriminate collectors of what can only be described as clutter.|那些从未搬过家的人，会无差别地收集各种杂物——这些杂物其实只能被归类为“杂乱无章的堆积物”。
[00:38.27]They leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics for years, in the belief that they may one day need just those very things.|他们把不需要的物品放在抽屉、橱柜或阁楼里多年，认为有朝一日自己可能会用到那些东西。
[00:48.40]As they grow old, people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons,|随着年龄的增长，人们积累物品还有另外两个原因：
[00:54.85]lack of physical and mental energy, both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away, and sentiment.|缺乏体力和精力——这两者都是完成某项任务所必需的；同时，也缺乏相应的情绪（或：缺乏完成任务的积极态度或动力）。
[01:03.55]Things owned for a long time are full of associations with the past,|那些已经拥有很长时间的东西，都承载着与过去相关的种种回忆和情感联系。
[01:08.41]perhaps with relatives who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.|也许这些物品与已经去世的亲人有关联，因此它们逐渐被赋予了超出其实际价值的意义（或：这些物品因为与逝去亲人的联系而变得更有价值）。
[01:16.11]Some things are collected deliberately in the home in an attempt to avoid waste.|有些物品是人们特意在家里收集起来的，目的是为了减少浪费。
[01:21.49]Among these I would list string and brown paper,|在这些物品中，我会列出“string”（一种线状材料）和“brown paper”（棕色纸）。
[01:24.50]kept by thrifty people when a parcel has been opened, to save buying these two requisites.|节俭的人在拆开包裹后，会保留这些物品，以避免再次购买这两样必需品。
[01:31.45]Collecting small items can easily become a mania.|收集小物件很容易变成一种强迫性行为（或者说，一种难以控制的癖好）。
[01:35.57]I know someone who always cuts sketches out from newspapers of model clothes that she would like to buy if she had the money.|我认识一个人，她总是从报纸上剪下那些她想要购买的模特服装的图片；如果她有钱的话，一定会买下这些衣服。
[01:43.88]As she is not rich, the chances that she will ever be able to afford such purchases are remote;|由于她并不富裕，她能够负担得起这类购买的费用的可能性微乎其微。
[01:51.93]but she is never sufficiently strongminded to be able to stop the practice.|但她始终缺乏足够的意志力，因此无法阻止这种行为（或：她始终无法坚定自己的立场，从而无法阻止这种不良现象的发生）。
[01:57.24]It is a harmless habit, but it litters up her desk to such an extent that every time she opens it, loose bits of paper fall out in every direction.|这其实是个无伤大雅的习惯，但这个习惯让她的办公桌变得非常杂乱——每次她打开桌子时，都会有一堆散落的纸屑从各个方向掉出来。
[02:09.31]Collecting as a serious hobby is quite different and has many advantages.|将收藏作为一种严肃的爱好来从事，其实有着许多独特的优势。
[02:15.15]It provides relaxation for leisure hours, as just looking at one's treasures is always a joy.|它为休闲时光带来了放松与愉悦；仅仅欣赏自己的收藏品，本身就是一种享受。
[02:22.72]One does not have to go outside for amusement, since the collection is housed at home.|人们不必外出寻找娱乐方式，因为这些藏品都收藏在家里。
[02:28.80]Whatever it consists of, stamps, records, first editions of books, china, glass,|无论这些东西是什么——印章、记录、书籍的初版、瓷器、玻璃制品……
[02:37.08]antique furniture, pictures, model cars, stuffed birds, toy animals, there is always something to do in connection with it,|古董家具、画作、模型汽车、毛绒玩具、玩具动物……总有一些事情可以与它们相关联、可以去做。
[02:47.44]from finding the right place for the latest addition, to verifying facts in reference books.|从为最新添加的内容找到合适的位置，到在参考书中核实事实……
[02:53.67]This hobby educates one not only in the chosen subject, but also in general matters which have some bearing on it.|这个爱好不仅能让人在所选择的领域内学到知识，还能帮助人们了解与该领域相关的一些通用性知识。
[03:02.06]There are also other benefits.|还有其他一些好处。
[03:04.94]One wants to meet like-minded collectors, to get advice, to compare notes, to exchange articles, to show off the latest find.|人们希望结识志同道合的收藏家，向他们请教建议，交流彼此的收藏心得，互相分享文章，以及展示自己最近发现的珍品。
[03:14.33]So one's circle of friends grows.|因此，一个人的朋友圈子也会逐渐扩大。
[03:17.07]Soon the hobby leads to travel, perhaps to a meeting in another town,|很快，这个爱好就发展成了旅行的动力——也许会促使我去另一个城镇参加某个会议。
[03:22.50]possibly a trip abroad in search of a rare specimen, for collectors are not confined to any one country.|也许他们会去国外寻找稀有的标本，因为收藏家们并不局限于某个特定的国家。
[03:30.33]Over the years, one may well become an authority on one's hobby and will very probably be asked to give informal talks to little gatherings|随着时间的推移，一个人很可能会在自己的爱好领域成为专家，并且很可能会被邀请在一些小型聚会上进行非正式的演讲。
[03:40.08]and then, if successful, to larger audiences.|然后，如果成功的话，就会面向更广泛的受众群体进行推广。
[03:44.84]In this way self-confidence grows, first from mastering a subject, then from being able to talk about it.|通过这种方式，自信心得以培养：首先是通过掌握某个学科的知识，然后是通过能够就该学科进行讨论或表达自己的观点来增强自信心。
[03:53.93]Collecting, by occupying spare time so constructively, makes a person contented, with no time for boredom.|通过利用空闲时间来从事有意义的活动，一个人会感到满足，从而不会有无聊的感觉。
