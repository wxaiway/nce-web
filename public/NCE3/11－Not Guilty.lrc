[00:23.00]Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty.|如今的海关官员通常比较宽容，但即便你通过绿色通道且没有任何需要申报的物品，他们仍有可能拦下你。

[00:33.67]even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase.|而那些老练的走私者则完全不会受到这种情绪的困扰——
[00:38.97]When I returned from abroad recently, a particularly officious young Customs Officer|即使他们的行李箱里藏着五百块金表。
[00:44.92]clearly regarded me as a smuggler.|最近我从国外回来时，一位特别爱管闲事的年轻海关官员明显把我当成了走私者。
[00:48.39]'Have you anything to declare?' he asked, looking me in the eye.|“您有什么需要申报的吗？”他直视着我的眼睛问道。
[00:54.07]'No,' I answered confidently.|“没有，”我自信地回答。

[01:07.71]All the things I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess.|我精心打包的所有东西，很快就变得一片狼藉。
[01:13.57]I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again.|我当时确信自己再也无法完成这个案子了。
[01:18.27]Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face light up.|突然，我看到那位警官的脸上露出了笑容。
[01:22.34]He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case|他在我的行李箱底部发现了一个小瓶子。

[01:29.35]'Perfume, eh?' he asked sarcastically.|“香水，是吗？”他讽刺地问道。
[01:34.68]'You should have declared that.|你本应该声明那一点的。

[01:49.55]'It's a strange mixture I make myself.|“这是我自制的某种奇怪混合物……”
[01:53.36]As I expected, he did not believe me.|正如我所料，他根本不相信我的话。
[01:57.25]'Try it!' I said encouragingly.|“试试看吧！”我鼓励地说道。

[02:11.96]A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.|几分钟后，我终于带着行李匆匆离开了——我的行李上留下了那些珍贵的粉笔痕迹。
