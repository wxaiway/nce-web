[00:21.26]Without it we could not make a living.|这条河流构成了我们农场的东边界，它一直都在我们的生活中扮演着重要的角色。
[00:24.33]There is only enough spring water to supply the needs of the house so we have to pump from the river for farm use.|没有它，我们就无法谋生。
[00:32.59]We tell the river all our secrets.|这里的泉水仅够满足房屋的需求，因此我们必须从河里抽水来用于农场灌溉。
[00:35.36]We know instinctively, just as beekeepers with their bees,|我们会把所有的秘密都告诉这条河流。
[00:39.98]that misfortune might overtake us if the important events of our lives were not related to it.|我们凭直觉明白：就像养蜂人照顾他们的蜜蜂一样，如果我们生活中的重要事件与这条河流无关，那么不幸可能会降临到我们身上。

[01:32.66]After a long period of rain the river may overflow its banks.|经过长时间的降雨，河流可能会泛滥出河岸。
[01:37.93]This is a rare occurrence as our climate seldom goes to extremes.|这种情况非常罕见，因为我们的气候很少会变得极端（即很少出现极端的温度或天气条件）。

[01:51.73]but other farms are less favourably sited, and flooding can sometimes spell disaster for their owners.|但其他农场的地理位置较为不利，洪水有时会对农场主造成严重的灾难性后果。

[02:32.65]and at the most critical juncture we took turns in watching that point.|在最关键的时刻，我们轮流负责监视那个地点（或目标）。
[02:37.80]The first sign of disaster was a dead sheep floating down.|灾难的第一个征兆是一只死羊漂浮在水面上。
[02:42.99]Next came a horse, swimming bravely,|接下来是一匹马，它勇敢地游着。
